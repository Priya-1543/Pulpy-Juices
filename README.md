# Pulpy-Juices
Pulpy-Juices is a web app built using Django. This project has two main functions, first, to take feedback from authentic users for the different products, and second, to provide the manager of the juice company with the analysis of the feedback received from all the customers. The analysis is represented using different graphs for better understanding.
